# MBC
The start of yet another 6502 build. Why MBC? Well it's going to be a Multi Board Computer with most of the I/O on a separate board. Full details can be found at http://tlcstuff.uk.

1> Get the processor running in free-run mode, using a Nano to provide alt variable rate clock and single-step functionality.

2> Add Eeprom and Ram.

3> Added video output, an MC monitor and a basic text editor.
